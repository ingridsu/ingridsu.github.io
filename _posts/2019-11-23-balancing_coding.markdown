Hello, my name is Ingrid
I decided to pursue something completely out of my element to expand my knowledge and hopefully improve my lifestyle.
I'm proud to say ive overcome a few life obstacles recently and im finally in a good spot to move forward in my education.
I quit my job at Zanies Comedy club to take on 5 months of FlatIron.
Talk about not knowing what your getting into. I never do.

As the first Month of the program comes close to an end, the anxiety of answering "Why did I start coding?" started creeping up enough times for me to finally sit and think. "WHY?! Why would I do this to myself?"
Remembering the time pry made me cry. 
My brain somehow could not understand the concept of code being stopped at the command of *binding.pry* to give me the opportunity to see if things were running properly. The over dramatic pity party I threw for myself  would have won an Oscar.Thanks to the help I received, I was able to move forward.

I came into this program very insecure. I don't know much about computers and I type slow. Getting past the negative thoughts, anxiety,and comparisons in my head have probably been harder than the program itself. 
It's definitely been an emotional roller coaster, but along with learning a whole new world in my case, Ive been able to learn the beauty of balance.It's something I've yet to perfect. taking breaks, asking for help, waking up at a new time to get the most out of my days.  I started coding in search of self improvement and hope to stick to it for the endless possibilities it may have in the future. Will I end up working for a tech company, a school, a makeup company? , for an alien scientist? 
fingers crossed it's the last one.
