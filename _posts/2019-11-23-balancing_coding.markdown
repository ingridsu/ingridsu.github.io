Hello, my name is Ingrid
I decided to persue something completly out of my element to expand my knowledge and hopefully improve my lifestyle.
Im proud to say ive overcome a few life obsticles recently and im finally in a good spot to move forward in my education.
I quit my job at Zanies Comedey club to take on 5 months of FlatIron.
Talk about not knowing what your getting into. I never do.

As the first Month of the program comes close to an end, the anxiety of answering "Why did I start coding?" started creeping up enough times for me to finally sit and think. "WHY?! Why would I do this to myself?"
Remembering the time pry made me cry. 
My brain somehow could not understand the concept of code being stopped at the command of *binding.pry* to give me the oppurtnity to see if things were running properly. The over dramatic pitty party I threw for myself  would have won an Oscar.Thanks to the help I recieved I was able to move forward.

I came into this program very insescure. I dont know much about computers and I type slow. Getting past the negative thoughts, the anxiety,and comparissons in my head have probably been harder than the program itself. 
It's definitely been a emotional roller coaster, but along with learning a whole new world in my case, Ive been able to learn the beauty of balance.It's something Ive yet to perfect. taking breaks, asking for help, waking up at a new time to get the most out of my days.  I started coding in search of self improvment and hope to stick to it for the endless posibilites it may have in my future. Will I end up working for a tech company?, a school?, a makeup company? , for an alien scientest? 
fingers crossed its the last one.

As I move forward I have no idea what to expect. It feels like a video game. Each lesson being a different level. I cant wait to get to the end of course and look back on everything I didint know and the things I will be able to create. I'm excited to learn and see what I can bring to the table after this coarse.
